# Assertion Server (Java)

This server is provided to help developers experiment with trusted authentication.
The goal is not to provide a fully production-ready server to secure your existing Grammarly implementation.

The code in this directory provides an example Java Spring Boot server that generates valid assertions for the Grammarly Text Editor SDK.

## Getting Started

You will first need to retrieve a private key in JWK format. You can do this by navigating to your app in the
[Grammarly Developer Hub](https://developer.grammarly.com/apps), selecting Trusted Authentication,
and then clicking **Generate new key**.

Copy the key into your clipboard. Then save the key in a file at `src/main/resources/private.jwk`:

    pbpaste > src/main/resources/private.jwk

(This filename has been added to `.gitignore` so that you don't accidentally check
in your private key.)

Now run the project with the command:

    gradle bootRun

The server should start. Note that the process will display something similar to `80% EXECUTING` while the server is running. You do not need to wait for the process to finish executing.

You can test the assertion endpoint by navigating to `http://localhost:8080?clientId=YOUR_CLIENT_ID` in your browser.
If everything is working, the page will display an assertion for the given client ID.

## How it Works

When a request arrives at this server, [JavaAssertionEndpointApplication](src/main/java/com/grammarly/g4d/JavaAssertionEndpointApplication.java) handles it.
This class extracts the client ID from the request and then creates a JSON Web Token (JWT). (Technically, it's actually a JWS, JSON Web Signature, which is a type of JWT.)
This JWT contains the necessary claims (such as issuer, subject, and audience) and is signed with the private key.
