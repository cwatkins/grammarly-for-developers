# Grammarly Text Editor SDK & Editor.js Example

This demo shows how to add the [Grammarly Text Editor SDK](https://developer.grammarly.com/) to a [Editor.js](https://editorjs.io/) rich text editor. The example uses [addPlugin()](https://developer.grammarly.com/docs/api/editor-sdk/editorsdk#addplugin) to add Grammarly suggestions in an imperative way.

## How it works

[index.html](./public/index.html) contains a `<div>`. JavaScript code toward the bottom of the file initializes the Editor.js text editor on that `<div>` and also adds Grammarly suggestions to that `<div>`. Check out [index.html](./public/index.html) for the full code example.

Learn more about how to add Grammarly suggestions to rich text editors by visiting the [Grammarly for Developers documentation](https://developer.grammarly.com/docs/#supported-text-editors).
