    <h1>Grammarly Button Menu Position</h1>
    <p>
      When you use the <code>grammarly-button</code> web component to
      place the Grammarly button in a custom position, you can choose whether
      the button menu appears to the left or right of the button. By default,
      the menu is placed to the left of the button.
    </p>
    <p>
      Select the Grammarly button beneath the text area. Notice that the menu
      opens to the <strong>left</strong> of the Grammarly button.
    </p>
    <p>
      You might notice that the Grammarly button is centered beneath the text 
      area, whereas in most examples in this repo, it appears on the right 
      (the default). We centered it so you can see the button menu opening to 
      the left and right of the button. Note that if there is not enough 
      space for the menu to be displayed in the designated position, the menu will
      automatically be placed in a position where it will fit.
