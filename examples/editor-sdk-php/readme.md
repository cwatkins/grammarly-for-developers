# Grammarly Text Editor SDK & PHP Example

This demo shows how to add the [Grammarly Text Editor SDK](https://developer.grammarly.com/) to a `<textarea>`, `<input>`, and `<div>` in a PHP app.

## How it works

[index.php](./public/index.php) contains a `<textarea>`, `<input>`, and `<div>`. The example uses the [`data-grammarly` attribute](https://developer.grammarly.com/docs/editor-sdk-intro#usage) to add Grammarly suggestions to the HTML elements. See [index.php](./public/index.php) for the full code example.

Learn additional ways to add Grammarly suggestions to JavaScript apps in the [Grammarly for Developers documentation](https://developer.grammarly.com/docs/editor-sdk-intro).

## How to run the example

Run the server locally:

```
cd public && php -S 127.0.0.1:3000
```
