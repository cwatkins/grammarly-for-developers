    <h2>The basics</h2>

    <p>
      Mispellings and grammatical errors can effect your credibility. The same
      goes for misused commas, and other types of punctuation . Not only will
      Grammarly underline these issues in red, it will also showed you how to
      correctly write the sentence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Underlines that are blue indicate that Grammarly has spotted a sentence
      that is unnecessarily wordy. You'll find suggestions that can possibly
      help you revise a wordy sentence in an effortless manner.
    </p>

    <p>
      But wait...there's more?
    </p>

    <p>
      Grammarly can give you very helpful feedback on your writing. Passive
      voice can be fixed by Grammarly, and it can handle classical word-choice
      mistakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It can even help when you wanna refine ur slang or formality level.
      That's especially useful when writing for a broad audience ranging from
      businessmen to friends and family, don't you think? It'll inspect your
      vocabulary carefully and suggest the best word to make sure you don't
      have to analyze your writing too much.
