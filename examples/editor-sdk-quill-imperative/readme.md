# Grammarly Text Editor SDK & Quill Example (Imperative)

This demo shows how to add the [Grammarly Text Editor SDK](https://developer.grammarly.com/) to a [Quill](https://quilljs.com/) rich text editor. The example uses [addPlugin()](https://developer.grammarly.com/docs/api/editor-sdk/editorsdk#addplugin) to add Grammarly suggestions in an imperative way.

## Try the Demo

You can try the demo in [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/grammarly/grammarly-for-developers/tree/main/examples/editor-sdk-quill-imperative?file=/public/index.html).

## How it Works

[index.html](./public/index.html) contains a `<div>`. JavaScript code toward the bottom of the file initializes the Quill text editor on that `<div>` and also adds Grammarly suggestions to that `<div>`. See [index.html](./public/index.html) for the full code example.

Learn more about how to add Grammarly suggestions to rich text editors by visiting the [Grammarly for Developers documentation](https://developer.grammarly.com/docs/#supported-text-editors).
