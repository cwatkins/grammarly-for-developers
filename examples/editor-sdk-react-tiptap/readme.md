# Grammarly Text Editor SDK & TipTap Example (React)

This demo shows how to add the [Grammarly Text Editor SDK](https://developer.grammarly.com/) to a [TipTap](https://tiptap.dev/) rich text editor in React.

## Try the demo

You can try the demo in [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/grammarly/grammarly-for-developers/tree/main/examples/editor-sdk-react-slate?file=/src/Editor.js).

## How it works

The `<GrammarlyEditorPlugin>` component wraps a TipTap rich text editor in order to add Grammarly suggestions to it. The `<Grammarly>` component wraps the `<GrammarlyEditorPlugin>` component and configures the Grammarly Text Editor SDK. See [Editor.js](./src/Editor.js) for the full code example.

Learn more about how to add Grammarly suggestions to rich text editors by visiting the [Grammarly for Developers documentation](https://developer.grammarly.com/docs/#supported-text-editors).
