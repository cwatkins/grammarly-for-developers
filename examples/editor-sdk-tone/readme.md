# Grammarly Text Editor SDK with Tone Detector

This demo shows how to add [Tone Detector](https://developer.grammarly.com/docs/api/editor-sdk/editorconfig#tonedetector) config to [Grammarly Text Editor SDK](https://developer.grammarly.com/).

## Try the Demo

You can try the demo in [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/grammarly/grammarly-for-developers/tree/main/examples/editor-sdk-tone?file=/public/index.html).

## How it Works

[index.html](./public/index.html) contains `<div contenteditable>` elements. These elements are wrapped with the `<grammarly-editor-plugin>` tag so that Grammarly suggestions will be displayed in them. JavaScript code toward the bottom of the file configures the Grammarly Text Editor SDK. See [index.html](./public/index.html) for the full code example.

## Get the Code

A copy of this code is available in the [Grammarly for Developers GitHub repo](https://github.com/grammarly/grammarly-for-developers/tree/main/examples/editor-sdk-tone).
