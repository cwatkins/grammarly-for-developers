# 3 Ways to Turn Off UI Elements in the Text Editor Plugin

This demo app shows three ways to turn off UI elements in the [Grammarly Text Editor SDK](https://developer.grammarly.com/).

## Try the Demo

You can try the demo in [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/grammarly/grammarly-for-developers/tree/main/examples/editor-sdk-turn-off-ui-elements?file=/public/index.html).

## How it Works

The app contains a textarea with default text. The Grammarly Text Editor Plugin has been added to the textarea. The default experience will be turned on when the page loads.

You can choose to turn off suggestion cards, underlines, or the entire plugin using the radio buttons below the textarea. Check out the functions in [index.html](./public/index.html) to see how these options are turned on or off.
